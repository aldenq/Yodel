# this file deals with the setup and interaction with the sender thread
# interaction is done through a pipeline and a stack
# the stack is used to give the sender thread data to send out
# the pipline is used to give other instructions to the thread, things like settings updates
# both the stack and the pipeline are assumed to be one-way, that being from the main thread to the sender thread
